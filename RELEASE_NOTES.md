- **Named Campaign: Ashes of the Black Emperor** — A Dragonlance mini-campaign set on Krynn. Requires 5 standard campaign clears. Features a pure flavor artifact and four outcomes with the heaviest persistent consequence in the game.

- **Named Campaign: Embers of the Second War** — A Planescape mini-campaign set in Dis, the Iron City. Requires 5 standard campaign clears. Features a legendary artifact with unique properties.
- **Named Campaign: The Shattered Memory of Darkon** — A Ravenloft mini-campaign set in Darkon. Requires 5 standard campaign clears. Features a unique artifact.
- **HP dice rolls on character creation** — Starting HP is now rolled on the class hit die rather than using a fixed value. Each class maps to its correct die (d4 through d12).

### Changed v1.5.0

- **Fight timeout extended** from 5 minutes to 20 minutes. AFK players have more time before the monster finishes them off.

### Fixed v1.5.0

- **`!revive` HP calculation** was incorrectly multiplying die size by character level. It now rolls the class hit die once per level, same as normal level up.

### Internal

- `CLASS_HP` removed and replaced with `CLASS_HP_DIE` and `rollHp` across `engine.ts`, `join.ts`, `party.ts`, `strike.ts`, `revive.ts`, `weekly.ts`, and `classes.ts`.

## v1.4.4 — April 16, 2026

### Al-Qadim Named Campaign & Codebase Cleanup

### Added v1.4.4

- **`!campaign alqadim`** — Second named campaign: *The Seal of the Incomparable*
  (Al-Qadim / Zakhara setting).
  - Requires 10 standard campaign clears to unlock.
  - Higher difficulty than the standard gauntlet (+25% base enemy HP and damage).
  - Five unique stages with named enemies, special abilities, and per-stage flavor text
    drawn from Al-Qadim lore, revised to avoid orientalist tropes.
  - Two rival factions — the Emerald Concordat and the Ashen Throne — converge at the
    Stage 5 confrontation alongside the boss.
  - Three-way ending vote: Use the Seal, Destroy the Seal, or Return it to the
    Elemental Planes. All three outcomes trigger distinct consequence flags.
  - Unique title pool (8 titles, 3 locked to specific outcomes) and artifact:
    The Seal of the Incomparable.

- **Al-Qadim consequence system** — Three new persistent cross-campaign effects:
  - `seal_bound` — Gold drain (30% of current gold) fires after 3–5 campaigns.
  - `convergence_marked` — 20% chance per campaign stage that a rogue elemental spawns
    before the normal enemy. Elemental spawn uses its own lightweight combat loop.
  - `genie_debt` — Genie noble demands payment after 2–3 campaigns: 25% of gold, or
    20% of max HP if the player cannot afford it.

- **Elemental spawn system** — New `runElementalSpawn()` function and
  `ELEMENTAL_SPAWN_POOL` in `named_campaigns.ts`. Four elemental types: Fire, Earth,
  Air, Water. Fires mid-campaign before the stage enemy when `convergence_marked` is
  active on any living participant. Only one spawn per stage even with multiple marked
  players.

### Changed

- **`mystara_campaign.ts` renamed to `named_campaigns.ts`** — The file now serves as
  the single handler for all named campaigns. All future campaigns are seeded via
  migration SQL only; no new TypeScript files are needed per campaign.
- **`router.ts`** — Import updated to reflect the rename.
- **`checkConsequences()`** — Extended with `seal_bound` and `genie_debt` session-start
  triggers alongside existing Mystara consequence checks.
- **`writeConsequences()`** — Extended with `seal_bound`, `convergence_marked`, and
  `genie_debt` cases in the switch block.
- **`runNamedCampaign()`** — Convergence spawn check added to the stage loop before
  each `runNamedStage()` call.
- **Unlock requirement for all named campaigns updated to 10 standard clears.**

### Database v1.4.4

- Extended `player_consequence_flags.flag_type` constraint: added `seal_bound`,
  `convergence_marked`, `genie_debt`
- New columns on `player_consequence_flags`: `seal_campaign_counter`, `seal_trigger_at`,
  `seal_triggered`, `debt_campaign_counter`, `debt_trigger_at`, `debt_triggered`
- Seeded `named_campaigns`, `named_campaign_stages`, `named_campaign_outcomes`,
  `named_campaign_titles`, `named_campaign_artifacts` for slug `alqadim`
- Updated `active_player_consequences` view — extended `trigger_ready` to cover
  `seal_bound` and `genie_debt`
- Updated `increment_campaign_counters` RPC — now increments `seal_campaign_counter`
  and `debt_campaign_counter` alongside existing Mystara counters

### Files v1.4.4

- `src/commands/named_campaigns.ts` (renamed from `mystara_campaign.ts`)

- **Brother Yvannis** — Cleric NPC who appears once per campaign at a random stage (1–4) alongside the rest shrine.
  - Offers five services: Cure Disease, Cure Blindness, Cure Paralysis, Heal, and Wish.
  - Costs are percentage-based on the player's current gold (10%–40%).
  - Checks player condition before charging — will not perform a service that does nothing.
  - Each player may interact with him once per appearance.
  - 90-second interaction window. Yvannis departs when the window closes.
  - Appearance stage is rolled randomly (1–4) at campaign creation and stored in the `campaigns` table.

- **`!campaign mystara`** — First named campaign: *The Crystal of Rafiel* (Mystara/Hollow World setting).
  - Requires one standard campaign clear to unlock. Higher difficulty than the standard gauntlet (+25% base enemy HP and damage, further modified by channel consequence flags).
  - Five unique stages with named enemies, special abilities, and per-stage flavor text drawn from Mystara lore.
  - Ending vote fires after the boss is defeated. Participants vote on one of four outcomes. Tiebreaker opens to all of chat. Random fallback if still tied.
  - Four outcomes with distinct mechanical consequences: Stabilize, Destroy, Take Control, Let It Spread.
  - Consequences persist across future campaigns and are stored per-player and per-channel in Supabase.
  - Unique title pool (8 titles, some locked to specific outcomes) and artifact: Crystal of Rafiel.

- **Named campaign system** — Infrastructure supporting all future named campaigns.
  - Tables: `named_campaigns`, `named_campaign_stages`, `named_campaign_outcomes`, `named_campaign_titles`, `named_campaign_artifacts`.
  - Unlock gating via `player_campaign_clears` — tracks standard and named clears per player per slug.
  - Difficulty modifier stored per campaign, applied to all enemy stats at runtime.
  - Channel-wide difficulty flag (`spread_difficulty_active`) stacks with per-campaign modifiers.

- **Consequence system** — Persistent cross-campaign effects stored in Supabase.
  - `player_consequence_flags` — per-player flags for `corruption_stabilized`, `crystal_control`, `shadow_marked`, `disease`, `blindness`, `paralysis`.
  - `channel_consequence_flags` — channel-wide difficulty bumps.

  - Consequence checks fire at session start on any command via `checkConsequences()` in `router.ts`.
  - Assassin death and madness trigger are checked against per-player campaign counters incremented by RPCs.

### Database v.1.4.3

## v1.4.2 — April 14, 2026

### !campaign — New multi-stage campaign system. One campaign per channel per day

- Solo or party mode. Party mode opens a 60-second join window via `!joincamp`.
- Five stages of escalating difficulty: *Skirmish → Ambush → Patrol → Elite Guard → Minor Boss.*
- Rest shrine fires before each stage after the first, restoring 20 HP to all living players.
- HP carries over between stages. No full heal between fights.
- Permadeath applies per player. Dead players are out; surviving party members continue.
- If all players die, the campaign ends in defeat and the daily cooldown is consumed.
- Boss drawn randomly from a pool of 18 named villains rooted in D&D/Forgotten Realms lore.
- Stage 3 enemy uses a named special ability. Stage 4 elite uses a power move drawn from a rotating pool.
- Boss fires a named special attack at round 2 hitting all living party members.
- Full clear awards scaling XP and gold, a unique title (drawn from a pool of 10), and one minor artifact drop to a random survivor (drawn from a pool of 12).
- Dead players earn XP and gold only for stages they survived.

### Database v.1.4.2

**New tables:** campaigns, campaign_participants, campaign_stage_log, campaign_rewards
**New seed tables:** campaign_boss_pool (18 entries), campaign_artifact_pool (12 entries), campaign_title_pool (10 entries)
**New view:** campaign_today — used to enforce the channel-wide daily cooldown

- `src/commands/campaign.ts` — full campaign handler
- `router.ts` — `!campaign` and `!joincamp` wired outside normal command map

## v1.4.0 — April 13, 2026

### Bug Fixes v1.4.0

#### Permadeath + Flee race condition

Fixed an issue where a player who died in combat could still trigger the `!flee` command. The flee handler now checks the database to confirm the character exists before proceeding, and cleans up any stale fight state.

#### Tavern Brawl fizzle reset

Fixed an issue where `!brawl` could not be started again after a brawl fizzled out due to insufficient participants. `tavernVisitors` is now cleared on brawl cancel and brawl end, and the triggering player is now added via `addParticipant` instead of a direct array push.

#### Weekly reward double-write

Fixed a race condition in `!weekly` where two separate database writes were made, leaving the character in an inconsistent state if the bot restarted between them. Now uses a single atomic update. Also fixed the level-up message not appearing in the weekly reward chat response.

#### Party raid XP missing level recalc

Fixed an issue where defeating a raid boss granted XP to party members but never recalculated or updated their level, causing level/XP desync. Party members now correctly level up after a successful raid.

#### Duplicate item stat negation

Two equipped items with the same name no longer stack stat bonuses. Only the first equipped instance counts toward stats. Players are warned in chat when equipping a duplicate item that the second copy provides no bonus.

### Improvements

#### Equip command

Players can no longer equip an item that is already equipped, preventing the same item from occupying two slots.

#### Code Quality

Removed unused `tmi` import from `flee.ts`
Removed unused `formatClass` import from `party.ts`
Removed unused `getPartyById` import from `party.ts`
Replaced dynamic `await import()` calls in `party.ts` with static top-level imports for `calculateLevel` and `CLASS_HP_DIE`

## v1.3.0 — April 12, 2026
